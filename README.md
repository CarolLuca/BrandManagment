* PROJECT DESCRIPTION *
This project develops a system to control the flow of
the in and out products of a couple of stores with the
same merchandise range.

* MOTIVATION *
The theme of this project was chosen in concordance with
the lessons taught during this semester, in order to use
as much concepts as possible from them, rather than a 
more catchy project that lacks to show the importance of
teh learnt tehnics and algorithms.

* TEAM WORK *
The project was developed by two students, in two very
delimitated pahese: in the first phase, a general outlook
on the algorithm behind the system was concluded; followed
by a second phase in which tasks were picked and implemented
by the preorganized model from the previos stage.

* CONCEPTS *
A list of concepts that were presented in the courses can be:
dynamically allocated memory, bitwise operations, working with
files, hashtable, priority queue, trie, query manipulation etc.

* DIFICULTIES *
All the dificuties are mainly time-related because of all the
other projects and tasks that have close deadlines, but good time
managment proved to make them all seem stressless.

* PERSONAL BENEFITS *
Accentuated the importance of working in a team, and raised the
problem of knowing how to communicate your idea is unserstood by everyone.

* USE CASES *
This project can be used for a small company with a small number of products,
but which owns a couple of stores around the town.
